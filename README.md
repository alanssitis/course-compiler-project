# ECE 573 Micro C Compiler

Semester-long compiler project written for ECE 573 (Fall 2022), converts Micro
C to a custom RiscV assembly instructions. Took it as an opportunity to learn
Rust and learned a lot on the way. Since correctness was the main focus over
compiler performance, inefficiencies exist throughout the code base (e.g.
unnecessary clones).
